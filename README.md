Zomato Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes customer and restaurant data from Zomato's food delivery service. The goal is to explore key insights using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI, with a focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to help Zomato make data-driven decisions.

Project Objectives
Analyze Zomato’s dataset to uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior.
Explore restaurant partner statistics and their contribution to the platform's success.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables.
Create data visualizations that highlight important business insights.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For data loading and DataFrame operations.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualizations.
Power BI: For creating a dynamic dashboard with insights.
Dataset
The dataset contains customer and restaurant information from Zomato’s platform. Key columns include:

name: Restaurant name.
online_order: Whether the restaurant accepts online orders.
book_table: Whether table booking is available.
rate: Restaurant ratings.
votes: Customer votes.
approx_cost(for two people): Estimated cost for two people.
listed_in(type): Restaurant type (e.g., cafe, dining).
Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and distributions within the dataset.
Data Visualizations: Count plots, bar charts, and other visual representations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Power BI Dashboard: A user-friendly interface to visualize restaurant and customer trends.
